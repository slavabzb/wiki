# The Meetings

## Key Points

* Any meeting has a purpose. There are no appointments on the calendar without an agenda.
* If you call a meeting, prepare the docs and send them to the team in advance. Explain the goal to every team member, let them ask questions and then go to the meeting.
* If the team calls a meeting, plan extra time and be ready you won't finish on time.
* If someone is silent, don't be lazy to agree on a goal at a separate meeting. Silent members are the most dangerous. If there are at least two silent members, it's likely that they affect the rest of the team. If they strongly disagree, they will sabotage. These members are not motivated, you should work on it.
* If the team is inert and silent, you should be the person who asks.
* Agree to expectations from each role.

## Agree on a Goal (20 mins)

* What's your goal (for the near future)?
* How does it match with our team goals?
* How this project will develop you?
* How this project can help you rich your goal?
* What are you ready to bring to this project, what new way are you ready to go to let you and your team benefit from this project?
* What is your plan?
* How can I help you?

## If Someone is Silent

* The more stressed person is, the more socially approved answers he gives.
* The speech becomes more complicated. Usually he speaks easy, but now the speech pace has changed.
* His actions don't match his words.

### What to Do?

Ask him what went wrong.

> Hey, you want to help the team, but it seems different to me. In the meetings you say this and that, but then actually do something opposite. How does it seem to you? Do you want the truth? \[You manipulate here and then tell how the things actually are.]
