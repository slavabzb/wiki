# Remote Team

The remote format robs us of humanity. Magic and chemistry happen between people, not between employees.

In a remote team the leader is annoying in the good sense of the word. He repeats the goals again and again.

Basic principle in remote team management â€“ everything is the same, but the faults are perceived sharper and affect more.

## The Strength of the Team

As a manager, you have the strength of the team. One believes that this is all impossible. You ask who thinks this is possible. And now he is opposing not you, but the team, and you are just regulating this process.
