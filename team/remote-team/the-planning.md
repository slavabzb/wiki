# The Planning

## Key Points

* Do planning before a meeting. The meeting is just for sync. In the meeting speak briefly and to the point.
* Do spring planning in a separate meeting with a team member or a group of members. The meeting is just for sync.
* Clarify who is on this task â€“ everyone should accept responsibility.
* Facilitator is required. Let it be a team member, not a team leader. The team leader pulls the blanket and doesn't hear the team. The team leader interferes only if something went wrong.

### The Meeting Format

* **Intro**. The more the team is distributed, the longer this stage.
* **Checking** (metrics, tasks progress, etc.). The questions are allowed, but no discussion. When the holy war begins, the facilitator suggests to discuss it outside this meeting (another meeting with concrete agenda).
* **Browse agenda subjects**. The facilitator asks the owner of the subject what she wants.
* Each agenda subject is relevant for the whole team. Otherwise the facilitator suggests to discuss it outside this meeting.
* The meeting is time bounded. The number of subjects determines the time for discussion of one subject. It will make the meeting more dynamic.
* **Conclusion** and **exit**.
