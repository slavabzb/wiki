# Retro

Retro is a kind of team gatherings. We laugh a lot, relax, eat pizza and drink champagne.

We all drink from the same glasses. Or we all have the same background. Or we all wear the same. These small details create community and corporate culture. This is very uplifting. Employees receive a dose of happiness.

The meeting must have an opening.
