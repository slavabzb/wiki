# Out of the Crisis

### Chain Reaction: Quality, Productivity, Lower Costs, Capture the Market

There is a stable system of trouble in a manufacturing plant. And because that system is stable, improvement of quality is the responsibility of the management.

### Principles for Transformation of Western Management

Western style of management must change to halt the decline of Western industry, and to turn it upward. There are the elements of the transformation that must take place. There must be an awakening to the crisis, followed by action, management's job.

There should be some criteria by which anyone in the company may measure the performance of management. Everyone in the company should have a basis by which to answer the question: "How is our management doing?" Union leaders may ask the same question, and judge management by the same criteria.

The transformation may only be accomplishment by man, not by hardware \(computers, gadgets, automation, new machinery\). A company cannot buy its way into quality.

#### Best efforts not sufficient

Best efforts are essential. Unfortunately, best efforts, people charging this way and that way without guidance of principles, can do a lot of damage. Think of the chaos that would come if everyone did his best, not knowing what to do.

#### Need for consistency of effort

Suppose that \(1\) everybody new what to do. \(2\) Everybody did his best. Result: dissipation of knowledge and effort; results, far from optimum. There is no substitute for teamwork and good leaders of teams to bring consistency of effort, along with knowledge.

#### Guidance from questions and pronouncements of Lloyd S. Nelson

1. The central of management in all its aspects, including planning, procurement, manufacturing, research, sales, personnel, accounting, and law, is to understand better the meaning of variation, and to extract the information contained in variation.
2. If you can improve productivity, or sales, or quality, or anything else, by \(e.g.\) 5 percent next year without a rational plan for improvement, then why were you not doing it last year?
3. The most important figures needed for management of any organisation are unknown and unknowable.
4. In the state of statistical control, action initiated on appearance of a defect will be ineffective and will cause more trouble. What is needed is improvement of the process, by reduction of variation, or by change of level, or both. Study of the sources of product, upstream, gives powerful leverage on improvement.

Short-term profits are not a reliable indicator of performance of management. Anybody can pay dividends by deferring maintenance, cutting out research, or acquiring another company.

People that depend on dividends to live on should be concerned, not merely with the size of the dividend today, but also with the question of whether there will be dividends three years from now, five years from now, ten years from now. Management has the obligation to protect investment.

#### Support of top management is not sufficient

It is not enough that top management commit themselves for life to quality and productivity. They must know what it is that they are committed to – that is, what they must do. These obligations cannot be delegated. Support is not enough: action is required.

"... and if you can't come, send nobody."

These are the words in a letter that William E. Conway \(president and chief executive officer of the Nashua Corporation\) wrote to a vice-president in response to the latter's request for an invitation to visit the Nashua Corporation.

In other words, Mr. Conway told him, if you don't have time to do your job, there is not much that I can do for you.

A quality program for a community, launched by ceremonies with a speech by the governor, raising of flags, beating of drums, badges, all with heavy applause, is a delusion and a snare.

#### Condensation of the 14 Points for Management

The 14 points are the basis for transformation of American industry. It will not suffice merely to solve problems, big or little. Adoption and action on the 14 points are a signal that the management intend to stay in business and aim to protect investors and jobs. Such a system formed the basis for lessons for top management in Japan in 1950 and subsequent years.

The 14 points apply anywhere, to small organisations as well as to large ones, to the service industry as well as to manufacturing. They apply to a division within a company.

1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.
2. Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.
3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.
4. End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimise total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.
5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
6. Institute training on the job.
7. Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.
8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.
9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service.
10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.
11. Eliminate work standards \(quotas\) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.
12. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, _inter alia_, abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objective.
13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.
14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.

### Diseases and Obstacles

The 14 points constitute a theory of management. Their application will transform Western style of management. Unfortunately, deadly diseases stand in the way of transformation.

There are diseases and there are obstacles. The distinction is intended to be partly in terms of difficulty of eradication and partly in terms severity of the injury inflicted.

#### The Deadly Diseases

1. Lack of constancy of purpose to plan product and service that will have a market and keep the company in business, and provide jobs.
2. Emphasis on short-term profits: short-term thinking \(just the opposite from constancy of purpose to stay in business\), fed by fear of unfriendly takeover, and by push from bankers and owners for dividends.
3. Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review.
4. Mobility of management; job hopping.
5. Management by use only of visible figures \(counting the money\), with little or no consideration of figures that are unknown or unknowable.

#### Obstacles

1. Hope for instant pudding.
2. The supposition that solving problems, automation, gadgets, and new machinery will transform industry.
3. Search for examples \[of success in a similar product or service\].
4. "Our problems are different."
5. Obsolescence in schools. \[The best way for a student to learn a skill is to go to work in some good company, under masters, and get paid while he learns.\]
6. Poor teaching of statistical methods in industry.
7. Use of Military Standard 105D and other tables for acceptance.
8. "Our quality control department takes care of all our problems of quality."
9. "Our problems lie entirely in the work force."
10. False starts. \[They give satisfaction, something to show for effort, but they lead to frustration, despair, disappointment, and delay.\]
11. "We installed quality control." \[No. You can install a new desk, or a new carpet, or a new dean, but not quality control.\]
12. The unmanned computer.
13. The supposition that is only necessary to meet specifications.
14. The fallacy of zero defects.
15. Inadequate testing of prototypes.
16. "Anyone can comes to try to help us must understand all about our business."

### Questions to Help Managers

66. What are you doing about quality that you hope to provide to your customers four years from now?

### Quality and the Customer

There are several faces of quality.

1. Management's decision on specifications for the quality characteristics of parts, final product, performance, what service to offer now. The plant manager and all the people in production are concerned about the specifications of today. They have to know what their job is, now.
2. Management's decision on whether to plan ahead for product or service of the future.
3. The consumer's judgement of your product or service.

For many kinds of product and service, the consumer's judgement may require a year or even several years for formation. The purchaser of a new automobile can give you in a year from the date of purchase a more useful evaluation of the quality of the automobile then he could when it was new.

### Some New Principles of Training and Leadership

The aim of leadership should be to improve the performance of man and machine, to improve quality, to increase output, and simultaneously to bring pride of workmanship to people. Put in a negative way, the aim of leadership is not merely to find and record failures of men, but to remove the causes of failure: to help people to do a better job with less effort.

A leader must learn by calculation wherever meaningful figures are at hand, or by judgement otherwise, who if any of his people lie outside the system on one side or the other, and hence are in need either of individual help or deserve recognition in some form.

The leader also has responsibility to improve the system – i.e. to make it possible, on a continuing basis, for everybody to do a better job with greater satisfaction.

A third responsibility is to accomplish ever greater and greater consistency of performance within the system, so that apparent differences between people continually diminish.

### Operational Definitions, Conformance, Performance

In the opinion of many people in industry, there is nothing more important for transaction of business than use of operational definitions. It could also be said that no requirement of industry is so much neglected. One learns about operational definitions in colleges of liberal arts, in courses in philosophy and theory of knowledge, but hardly ever in schools of business or engineering in the United States. It could even be said that learning in physics, chemistry, and some natural sciences does not teach the philosophy of science.

Meaning starts with the concept, which is in somebody's mind, and only there: it is ineffable. The only communicable meaning of any word, prescription, instruction, specification, measure, attribute, regulation, law, system, edict is the record of what happens on application of a specified operation or test.

An operational definition puts communicable meaning into a concept. Adjectives like good, reliable, uniform, round, tired, safe, unsafe, unemployed have no communicable meaning until they are expressed in operational terms of sampling, test, and criterion. The concept of a definition is ineffable: it cannot be communicated to someone else. An operational definition is one that reasonable men can agree on.

An operational definition is one that people can do business with. An operational definition of safe, round, reliable, or any other quality must be communicable, with the same meaning to vendor as to purchaser, same meaning yesterday and today to the production worker. Example:

1. A specific test of a piece of material or an assembly.
2. A criterion \(or criteria\) for judgment.
3. Decision: yes or no, the object or the material did or did not meet the criterion \(or criteria\).

### Standards and Regulations

A government regulation, and likewise an industrial standard, to be enforced, must have operational meaning. Conformance can be judged only in terms of a test and a criterion \(sometimes many tests and many criteria\). The criteria and tests must be in statistical terms to have a meaning. A regulation or standard that is not so expressed will be devoid of meaning. A regulation without meaning can have no legal force.

### Common Causes and Special Causes of Improvement. Stable System

The central problem in management and in leadership is failure to understand the information in variation. He that possesses even a fuzzy understanding of it would understand the futility of the annual rating of performance of people as a basis for raises or for promotion. He would understand that the type of action required to reduce special causes of variation is totally different from the action required to reduce variation and faults from the system itself; would understand the capability of a process and of a system of measurement; would appreciate the necessity for statistical control of use of instruments and gauges; would understand that adjustment of an instrument to a standard should be carried out only on statistical evidence of stability of both instruments; would understand that leadership that takes aim at people that are below average in production, or above average in mistakes, is wrong, ineffective, costly to the company; that the same holds for a leader that supposes that everyone could be an achiever. He would understand why it is that costs decrease as quality improves. It is essential, however, in industry and in science to understand the distinction between a stable system and an unstable system, and how to plot points and conclude by rational methods whether they indicate a stable system. The points might show \(e.g.,\) weekly figures on sales, quality incoming and outgoing, complaints of customers, inventory, absenteeism, accidents, fires, accounts receivable, beneficial days.

#### Special causes and common causes

A fault in the interpretation of observations, seen everywhere, is to suppose that every event \(defect, mistake, accident\) is attributable to someone \(usually the one nearest at hand\), or is related to some special event. The fact is that the most troubles with service and production lie in the system.

Most troubles and most possibilities for improvement add up to proportions something like this:

* 94% belong to the system \(responsibility of management\),
* 6% special.

"We rely on our experience." The answer is self-incriminating: it is a guarantee that this company will continue to pile up about the same amount of trouble as in the past. Why should it change?

Experience without theory teaches nothing. In fact, experience cannot even be recorded unless there is some theory, however crude, that leads to a hypothesis and a system by which to catalog observations. Sometimes only a hunch, right or wrong, is sufficient theory to lead to useful observation.

#### What is the system?

To people in management, the system consists of

* Management, style of
* Employees – management and everybody
* The people in the country
  * Their work experience
  * Their education
  * The unemployed
* Government
  * Taxes
  * Reports
  * Tariffs
  * Impediments to trade and industry
  * Requirements to fill positions by quota, not by competence
  * Quotas for import and export
* Foreign governments
  * Quotas for import and export
  * Manipulation of currency
* Customers
* Shareholders
* Bank
* Environmental constraints

Management has much power and discretion, but cannot move all the earth. To the production worker, the system is all but him.

There are two sources of loss from confusion of special causes with common causes of variation.

1. Ascribe a variation or a mistake to a special cause when in fact the cause belongs to the system \(common causes\).
2. Ascribe a variation or a mistake to the system \(common causes\) when in fact the cause was special.

Overadjustment is a common example of mistake 1. Never doing anything to try to find a special cause is a common example of mistake 2.

> People are part of the system; they need help.
