# The Happiness Advantage

## Positive psychology at work

The most individuals follow a formula that has been taught to them by their schools, their company, their parents, or society. That is: _If you work hard, you will become successful, and once you become successful, **then** you'll be happy._ Success first, happiness second.

The only problem is that this formula is broken because it is backward. Research in the fields of positive psychology and neuroscience has proven that happiness and optimism actually _fuel_ performance and achievement.
